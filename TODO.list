TODO list

---------------------------------------  TODO list for version 0.1  -------------------------------
date: 12/20/2014
1) Problems of "convert"
a) cannot solve disorder in the original SNAP file. 
    Only supports soc, twitter and ydata. Needs to support more real-world graphs.
b) no progress bar. 
    Users don't know where they are.
c) More flexible weight value input. 
    Should support the weight column later.

2) More example algorithms
a) SCC. Optimize?
b) Triangle Counting. Optimize?
c) MSF. Optimize?

3) Use the up-to-date value (in the attribute buffer) to further decrease iteration numbers.
